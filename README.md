Proposal:   This is a trivia application focused on Socialist History. The questions are all multiple choice. It's also possible to take multiple quizzes.

            Must have featuers: 
            -The user must be able to attempt different quizzes.
            -The user must be able to see their score.
            
            Nice to have features:
             -The user can enter their score into a leaderboard.
             -The user can view the top score leaders for each quiz.
