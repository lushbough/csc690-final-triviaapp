Proposal:   This is a trivia application focused on Socialist History. The questions are all multiple choice. It's also possible to take multiple quizzes.

            Must have features: 
            -The user must be able to attempt different quizzes.
            -The user must be able to see their score.
            
            Nice to have features:
             -The user can enter their score into a leaderboard.
             -The user can view the top score leaders for each quiz.

Accomplished/Unaccomplished: 

             - We are able to have multiple screens, views, and cycle through an array of questions plus select an answer.
             - However, we are unable to keep score or keep a leaderboard. Also unable to see what questions we got correct.
            
I had a hard time figuring out what the problems with my IDE were. I had to change my whole project because I use a school laptop (since I do not own a mac) and it has an outdated version of Xcode where I cannot use things like StateObject. I also cannot update the Xcode on a school laptop because I do not have the permissions to do so.
